*interviewer*:Do you do you have any teamwork experience in your study? Can you describe that teamwork experience in university?

**interviewee**: Yeah. OK, so the first semester I was here, I was in DECO 1100, which was a course where we made groups, and we had a team report. We had to come up with ideas based on problem spaces that we found at the university. And in semester two, I attended DECO 1800, which is another group course about making a website, and we chose to make one about Brisbane's parking spaces. My first semester of year two didn't have much group work. But this semester, I have another group course, which is Deco 2850, and I'm looking forward to it.

*interviewer* :Nice. Do you prefer to group by yourself or by the teacher? why or why not

**interviewee**: In courses where I have friends, I would prefer to group by myself. But in courses where I don't know anyone, I don't really mind either way. Yeah, I'm a friendly person, 

*interviewer*: Has your group had after class meetings? How often do you contact?

**interviewee**: We never have after class meetings. I tend to do my tasks during the course, or we just tend to text more rather than have meetings. I usually do a lot of work anyways, so it's okay.

*interviewer*: Do you think it's necessary to design a small app, or maybe a program for teamwork?

**interviewee**: I don't know what you would use it for, because there are already social media websites and apps that let you communicate. But I would be keen to try if you came up with anything Maybe for the timetable, maybe.

*interviewer*: That works. Yeah. If you are a designer, what section do you want to design for the teamwork app?

**nterviewee**: nterfaces, probably on Figmaâ€”UX stuff. I'm pretty good at coding, not too much, but I mean I could do it.
